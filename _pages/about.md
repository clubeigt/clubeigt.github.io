I received the Eng. degree in Aeronautics Engineering from [ISAE SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/), Toulouse, France in 2018 and defended in February 2023 my Ph.D degree in Signal Processing applied to GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) with the [CNES](https://cnes.fr) and [ISAE SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr) under the supervision of [Pr. Eric Chaumette](https://pagespro.isae-supaero.fr/eric-chaumette/biography.html), [Pr. Jordi Vilà-Valls](https://jordivilavalls.wordpress.com) at the cooperative laboratory [TéSA](https://tesa.prd.fr).

I am now working as research assistant at ISAE-SUPAERO where I work on novel signal processing techniques to perform ground-based GNSS-R.
