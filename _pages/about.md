I received the Eng. degree in Aeronautics Engineering from [ISAE SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/), Toulouse, France in 2018 and defended in February 2023 my Ph.D degree in Signal Processing applied to GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) with the [CNES](https://cnes.fr) and [ISAE SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr) under the supervision of [Pr. Eric Chaumette](https://pagespro.isae-supaero.fr/eric-chaumette/biography.html), [Pr. Jordi Vilà-Valls](https://jordivilavalls.wordpress.com) at the cooperative laboratory [TéSA](https://tesa.prd.fr).

Following my graduation, I lingered at ISAE-SUPAERO as a Post-doc where I worked on different studies involving:
 - ground-based GNSS-R signal model for deterministic estimation of reflection coefficients;
 - Bayesian approaches for propagation channel impulse response estimation.

I am now a Post-doc at [Météo France](https://meteofrance.com/) in the _Centre de Météorologie Radar_ department where I work on signal processing techniques for upcoming precipitation radar technologies.
