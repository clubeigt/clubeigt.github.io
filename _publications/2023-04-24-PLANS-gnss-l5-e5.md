Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are a key player in a plethora of applications. For navigation purposes, interference scenarios are among the most challenging operation conditions, which clearly impact the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of the signal synchronization parameters. While several interference mitigation techniques exist, a theoretical analysis on the GNSS MLE performance degradation under interference, being fundamental for system/receiver design, is a missing tool. The main goal of this contribution is to introduce a mathematical tool to evalute the effect of any type of interference on any GNSS signal. Regarding such tool, we provide closed-form expressions of the misspecified Cram ́er-Rao (MCRB) bound and estimation bias, for a generic GNSS signal corrupted by an interference. The proposed expressions are used to analyze the GNSS performance degradation induced by the distance measuring equipment (DME) system.
