In ranging-based applications, ignoring the presence of multipath often leads to a bias upon the estimated range, which actually originates from misspecified estimation problem because the assumed data signal model, here without multipath, is not equal to the true one. Such misspecification also results in an error covariance matrix around the biased estimates, so-called pseudotrue parameters, that differs from the Cramér–Rao bound applied to the true model. This error covariance matrix can be lower bounded by a misspecified Cramér–Rao bound (MCRB). In this work, a closed-form expression of the MCRB under multipath conditions is proposed, which only depends on the baseband signal samples and both delay, Doppler and complex amplitude pseudotrue parameters. These MCRB expressions are fundamental (i) to understand and characterize the impact of multipath conditions when not taken into account, (ii) for system/signal design, and (iii) to derive new robust estimators. The proposed MCRBs are validated for a representative navigation signal, comparing the resulting bounds with the mean square error obtained by the misspecified maximum likelihood estimator with respect to the pseudotrue parameters.
