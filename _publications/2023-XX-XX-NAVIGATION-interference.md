excerpt: 'In this paper, a closed form expression of the misspecified Cramér-Rao bound is derived for the case of a GNSS receiver with an unknown interference. This result is illustrated with simulations involving a GPS L1 C/A signal and a jammer using an LFM signal.'

Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are a key player in a plethora of applications, ranging from navigation and timing, to Earth observation or space weather characterization. For navigation purposes, interference scenarios are among the most challenging operation conditions, which clearly impact the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of the signal synchronization parameters. While several interference mitigation techniques exist, a theoretical analysis on the GNSS MLE performance degradation under interference, being fundamental for system/receiver design, is a missing tool. The main goal of this contribution is to provide such analysis, by deriving closed-form expressions of the misspecified Cramér-Rao (MCRB) bound and estimation bias, for a generic GNSS signal corrupted by an interference. The proposed bias and MCRB expressions are validated for a linear frequency modulation chirp signal interference.
