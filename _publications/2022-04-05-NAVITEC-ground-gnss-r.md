For more than three decades, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals have been seen as signals of opportunity as in GNSS Reflectometry (GNSS-R). The study of the reflections from the ground of such signals can indeed lead to many features regarding the reflecting surface and the receiver's height. Due to the nature of the GNSS signal, that is, due to its wavelength, the distortion of the reflected signal may vary significantly depending on the reflecting surface and on the dynamic and height of the receiver. The latter does range from low earth orbit down to ground-based platforms. In this last case, the vicinity to the ground induces important interference between the direct and the reflected path which makes it difficult to process directly in order to obtain altimetry product. In this study, the feasibility of ground-based single antenna GNSS-R altimetry is studied and solutions are presented depending on the satellite elevation angle. To do so, maximum-likelihood-based algorithms-namely the CLEAN-RELAX Estimator and the Approximate Maximum Likelihood Estimator-are presented and applied to a set of scenarios.
